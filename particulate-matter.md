# Particulate Matter (PM)

Particulate Matter (PM) refers to a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets in the air. Some are large enough to be seen (dust, soot, dirt), while others are microscopic.

### Types of PM Based on Size
- **PM₁₀** – inhalable particles ≤ 10 μm  
- **PM₂.₅** – fine inhalable particles ≤ 2.5 μm  
- **PM₁** – ultrafine particles ≤ 1 μm

### Health Effects of PM

- Larger particles lodge in the nose and throat.
- Particles <1 μm penetrate deep into the lungs and bloodstream.
- Long-term exposure leads to:
  - Asthma
  - Heart diseases
  - Lung cancers
  - Decreased lung function
  - Increased premature deaths

**Common Symptoms:** wheezing, coughing, dry mouth, difficulty breathing, chest tightness.
