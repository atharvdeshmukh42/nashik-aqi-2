# Air Pollution

Air pollution results from excessive concentrations of harmful substances in the air due to both natural processes and human activities. Rapid economic development, motorization, urbanization, and energy consumption have significantly increased pollution levels in India.

### Causes of Air Pollution
- Combustion of fossil fuels
- Industrial emissions
- Dust, soot, smoke, and gaseous pollutants
- Natural sources like wildfires, volcanic activity, and desert storms

### Consequences
High concentrations of air pollutants cause:
- Respiratory and cardiovascular diseases
- Reduced visibility
- Damage to the environment, ecosystem, and infrastructure
- Climate change and atmospheric radiation imbalance

### Indian Standards Institution IS 4167 (1966)
Air pollution occurs when concentrations of pollutants exceed permissible limits. Common pollutants include:
- Particulate Matter (PM)
- Ozone (O₃)
- Carbon Monoxide (CO)
- Sulfur Dioxide (SO₂)
- Nitrogen Oxides (NOx)
- Lead (Pb)
